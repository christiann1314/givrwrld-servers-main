## 1. THE FORGE

**Prompt:**  
Open on a vast, dim hall. In the center, a single forge burns—embers and flame in deep emerald and gold, not orange. Steam and heat distortion rise. An anvil sits before it, unmarked. Camera slowly pushes in. A hand enters frame and places a single key on the anvil. The key catches the forge light; it glows. Cut to a wide shot: countless other anvils recede into the darkness, each with a small flame, each a seat. No face, no brand—only the gesture of claiming. Cinematic, 2.39:1, film grain, motivated by firelight. Mood: solemn, empowering. **10 sec.**

## 2. THE AGE BEFORE

**Prompt:**  
A lone figure walks through a maze of grey, identical doorways—cold light, no warmth. They try a door; it’s locked. Another; someone else’s name is on it. They keep walking, never stopping, never at home. Camera tracks beside them, then slowly cranes up to show the maze stretching to the horizon. Fade to black. Then: one door ahead swings open from the inside. Warm emerald light spills out. The figure walks toward it and steps through. We don’t follow. We hold on the open door, the light, the end of wandering. Desaturated to start, rich emerald and gold at the end. **12 sec.**

## 3. YOUR SEAT

**Prompt:**  
Empty throne room, stone and glass. A single chair at the head of a long table. No one in it. Camera orbits the chair—slow, reverent. With each pass, the table fills: glowing screens, maps, a banner with a custom sigil, then faint silhouettes of a community taking their seats. The head chair stays empty until the last second, when we cut to a first-person view: our hands on the armrests, the room ours. Emerald accent light from high windows. Mood: sovereignty, ownership, “this is mine.” **8 sec.**

---

## 4. ONE CLICK, ONE REALM

**Prompt:**  
Extreme close-up: a finger taps a single key on a keyboard. The tap triggers a ripple. Cut to a wide: the ripple becomes a shockwave across a twilight landscape—grass, mountains, a distant keep. The keep’s banner unfurls. Lights turn on in the towers. One by one, tiny figures appear on the walls. The camera pulls back until the whole realm fits in frame: one world, one choice, one click. Clean, modern fantasy. Emerald and gold in the sky. **10 sec.**

---

## 5. THE LONG NIGHT

**Prompt:**  
Pitch black. A single flame appears—small, handheld, like a torch. The bearer walks forward; we see only their back and the flame. Around them, vague shapes of servers or gates that have gone dark. They keep walking. The flame doesn’t flicker out. More flames appear in the distance: other keepers, other realms. The darkness stays, but it’s no longer total. No dialogue. Sound design: wind, then a low, steady hum. Message: you hold the fire. **12 sec.**

---

## 6. EMERALD AND GLASS

**Prompt:**  
Abstract brand piece. A block of solid emerald slowly rotates in a void. Light passes through it—refractions, facets, depth. The block begins to resolve into architecture: the edge of a tower, a pane of glass, a dashboard. UI elements emerge from the light—clean, minimal, no text—then dissolve back into pure form. Everything is emerald, gold, and clear glass. Hypnotic, premium, no faces. 1:1 or 9:16 for social. **15 sec.**

---

## 7. THE HOUSE

**Prompt:**  
A round table in a hall. Diverse hands reach in from off-screen—placing a controller, a headset, a map, a drink. No faces; only hands and objects. The table fills. Then we pull back: the table sits in a larger hall with emerald-lit pillars. Banners hang. One empty chair at the head. Someone’s hand lands on that chair’s shoulder from behind. We don’t see who. Message: you built the house; they came. Warm, communal, Game of Thrones council vibe. **10 sec.**

---

## 8. THE PRICE OF IRON

**Prompt:**  
A single scroll or ledger lies open on a stone table. The numbers are clear, legible, honest. No shadows on the page. Light falls from above—emerald-tinted. A hand places a coin next to the ledger; the coin is translucent, almost symbolic. Cut to a key being handed over, then to a gate opening. No hidden doors, no twists. Straight line: you see the cost, you pay, you receive. Cinematic, dignified, transparency as power. **8 sec.**

---

## 9. BUILD. CREATE. OFFER. OWN.

**Prompt:**  
Four quick cuts, each a single powerful image. **Build:** hands stacking stone, building a wall. **Create:** a seed planted in soil; time-lapse, a tree grows. **Offer:** a door held open; silhouettes walk through into light. **Own:** a key turned in a lock; we push through the door into a sunlit realm—our realm. No text on screen; each word could be whispered or shown after. Rhythm: 2 sec, 2 sec, 2 sec, 4 sec. **10 sec.**

---

## 10. THE REALM AWAITS

**Prompt:**  
Aerial shot over a vast, beautiful landscape—mountains, forests, one river. Dawn light, emerald and gold. No people. Just the land. Camera descends slowly toward a single stronghold on a hill. The stronghold is lit, welcoming. We don’t land; we hold on the approach. Voice-over or text space: “The forge is hot. The anvil is true. The realm awaits those willing to build.” End on the horizon, infinite. **12 sec.**

## Usage Notes

- **Aspect ratio:** 16:9 or 2.39:1 for hero/YouTube; 9:16 for TikTok/Reels (reframe or regenerate).
- **Sound:** Add voice-over from the lore doc, or score only (epic, minimal, no cheese).
- **Text overlay:** Add logo and givrwrldservers.com at end; keep mid-video clean.
- **Tone:** Never cheesy. Solemn, confident, empowering. We’re not selling a product; we’re offering a compact.
